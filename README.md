## The Project
Web-Infighters was created for training my Javascript skills with the following technologies: jQuery, Vue and React to benchmark their performance and also analyse wich one is better for developping a Turn Based Combat Game higly inspired on famous JRPG games such as Pok√©mon and Persona.

## Visual Identity
The game is based in a retrowave universe with the fighters representing different areas of Computer Science (and a little bit of Math and Engineering). It's important to say that almost all the characters was only colored by me and it's lineart belongs to another author properly credited.
